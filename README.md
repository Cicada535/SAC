## About the Project
Simple Age Classification (SAC) is an open-source age classification system designed to ensure transparency and accessibility in information about age restrictions for various types of content, such as games, videos, and movies. It is inspired by the PEGI system and offers clear criteria for determining the appropriate age range for different types of content.

### Purpose of the Project:
- Provide a free and open alternative to proprietary age classification systems
- Help parents, guardians, and users make informed decisions about content
- Promote discussion and improvement of age classification standards
  
### Age Categories and Attributes
SAC utilizes the following age groups:
- 0+: Suitable for all ages
- 3+: Suitable for children ages 3 and up
- 5+: Suitable for ages 5 and older
- 7+: Suitable from ages 7 and up
- 10+: Ages 10 and older
- 12+: Ages 12 and above
- 14+: Suitable for teenagers aged 14 years and over.
- 16+: Suitable for teenagers aged 16 years and over. 
- 18+: Suitable only for adults.
By using these categories, users can easily determine the suitability of content for their audience.

**How to use SAC**
You can use SAC to: 
- Evaluate content and assign it an appropriate age rating. 
- Check existing age ratings and compare them with SAC criteria. 
- Develop new systems and tools for age classification.
